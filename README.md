# Setting up the Game

For this project, I used Unity 2022.3.19f1 with the "3D URP" project template.

I started by setting up the game environment with a board and maze made up of cubes. The board acts as the base, and the walls are built using individual cube objects to create a challenging maze layout.

To create a unique theme, I used the "Skybox Series Free" asset pack and selected the "Cosmic" skybox.

For the player/ball, I created a sphere and turned it into a shooting star by adding a Trail Renderer component.
